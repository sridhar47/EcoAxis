											The facility is designed with the highest standards of energy efficiency. Energy consumption in the production processes are continuously monitored and efforts taken to systematically reduce the energy consumed in the manufacture of each product.
										</p>
										<p>
											The office is similarly designed with the motive to provide comfort as well as reduce the energy footprint. New technologies have been integrated to create a working environment that is comfortable as well as energy-efficient.
										</p>
										<p>
											The &ldquo;mixed-mode&rdquo; air conditioning system, which permits both natural ventilation and mechanical cooling, helps achieve the brief of a seamless working environment. The maximum temperature complies with the recommendations of ASHRAE&apos;s Adaptive Model of Comfort and is designed not to exceed 28&deg;C inside the office space during the peak of Ahmedabad&apos;s summer.
										</p>
										<p>
										Air-conditioning systems in an office building of this size in a hot and dry climate zone like Ahmedabad alone can consume more than 85% of the total energy used annually. The building design itself incorporates several features that reduce the energy consumed by the air-conditioners. Passive features such as the reflective mosaic roof and green wall on East and South façades reduce the energyspend by about 10%. Extensive use of daylight reduces energy use in lighting. Using LED fixtures instead of conventional lighting systems reduces the energy spend by another 1.5%. The unique structural cooling system also reduces energy spend by reducing the quantity of water lost by evaporation. The biggest energy reduction measures are the use of Ambiators. These machines based on novel indirect evaporation cooling technology can save more than 40% of the energy consumed by conventional refrigerant-based air-conditioners. Since the Ambiators work on fresh air, they ensure a fresh working environment with healthy acceptable levels of carbon dioxide and free of odours. Ambiators are also an A.T.E. group product designed and built by A.T.E | HMX Rigorous computer building energy models estimate that these measures should help reduce the energy use intensity (EUI) by almost 40% from 145 kWh/m2-year (46 kBTU/ft2-year) to 90 kWh/m2-year (29 kBTU/ft2-year) and that the office building will annually consume about 63,250 units of electricity. Over the last year, the building performance has confirmed building modeling estimates, with an achieved energy performance index (EPI) of 78 kWh / m2 / year, making this one of the most energy efficient offices in India.

														The office and factory building share a common internal courtyard which is a combination of soft landscaping and paved areas, interspersed with shade loving trees. Ensuring that this open to sky area remains shaded for the majority of day is critical to the usability of this space. In the morning and evening the office building to the east and factory building to the west effectively shade the courtyard. Around noon when the sun is overhead, overhangs of the office building and trees planted in the courtyard shade approximately 75% of the paved area. Shading effect of the adjacent factory building to the west was considered to effectively reduce 10% of solar heat gain to the west side facade of the office building, according to the glass specification report of Saint-Gobain Glass.

														Passive ventilation is the movement of air through a building without the use of externally supplied energy. Integration of this phenomenon during the design process of the TeraSpin | A.T.E. office has ensured that non-airconditioned spaces remain cool, thereby saving energy and providing a comfortable working/ environment. Circulation passages and the “lung” have been provided with large openings along the east and west façades. Therefore, cool air of the courtyard enters the “lung”, picks up the heat from within the building and is pushed out from the openings along the east facade. The continuous movement of fresh air and helps in providing a healthy atmosphere which is cool and comfortable for users.

The lung is a composed indoor-outdoor space, closed from three sides and open towards the internal courtyard. Three façades of the lung are detailed with strategically located openings, while the roof is punctured by two large elliptical skylights. Various openings on multiple surfaces encourage for cross ventilation, thus keeping the space passivley cool, eliminating the need for fans or air conditioning. A large square planter is located near the center of the lung at the ground floor, and a second larger planter is located on the first floor. The incorporation of dense landscaping within the heart of the building further cools the space, while at the same time blurring the boundary between inside and outside

														<p>The manufacturing processes at the TeraSpin | A.T.E factory do not require water. Hence water is only required for the use of employees and landscaping. In addition, efficient air-conditioning systems use water chillers and cooling towers to exhaust heat from indoor spaces to the outside. Since the site is spread over a large area, and water consumption is only restricted to a few areas, A.T.E. took on the challenge to make the TeraSpin site a net-zero water site, i.e. the site does not consume more water than it “produces”, thereby reducing its footprint on the environment.</p>
														<p>
															The designers developed a “water balance diagram” for the site to quantify the water use in each area — water consumption. The size of the required air-conditioning system was aggressively reduced by incorporating passive cooling systems to reduce the heat load in the spaces to be cooled. The office building is rectangular with the south-facing sides smaller and without windows. The white mosaic roof reflects most of the solar radiation. The east and south walls have a “living” green façade that reduces solar heat gain. The factory building shades the major portion of the west wall. In addition, the roof and other slabs in the office building are embedded with pipes filled with slowly-flowing water. The water in this “structural cooling systems” extracts heat from the building and dissipates it into the ground when the water is stored overnight. These measures reduce the power that may have been consumed by a larger air conditioning system. Low-water fixtures are installed in wash areas, toilets and pantry areas to reduce water consumption. Finally, a sewage treatment plant with state-of-the-art membrane-based ultrafiltration treats all water to remove all traces of chemical and biological impurities. Thetreated water is recycled for landscaping use. A sophisticated rainwater harvesting system over the entire site collects rainwater from building roofs and paved areas, filters this water and then, recharges the ground. Based on design calculations, the average water consumption on the TeraSpin site is estimated to be 7,500 m3 annually, and the water “produced” by rainwater harvesting is estimated to be in excess of 8,600 m3 — about 15% higher than that consumed.

														TeraSpin | A.T.E. desire is to continuously measure and verify various aspects of the building performance and operation to facilitate quantification of energy used and conserved. TeraSpin | A.T.E. also uses this system to monitor equipment manufactured/used by A.T.E. group companies for design verification. These aspects are broadly classified as:
														1. Electrical energy consumed by lighting and factory loads.
														2. Electrical energy consumed by cooling loads like Ambiators and structural cooling pumps.
														3. Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) parameters like CO2 levels, temperature and humidity at specific points in the factory and the office.
														4. Water consumed and re-used in the facility. The solution is broadly classified as hardware needed for data acquisition and a remote server based software for storing and viewing data, reports and notifications. The monitoring requirements proposed here-in cover parameters from proposed analytics perspective too.
														The remote server hosts the software for data storage and display. The users can log on to the server using a standard web browser. They also get alerts and maintenance acts over SMS/email. (EcoAxis)
